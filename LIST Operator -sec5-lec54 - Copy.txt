List Operator : ; , & , && , ||   These are 4 types of list operator we have. We use these operators to create chain command.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

& : It's send 1st command in the background and process with the second command. Also let us know once the 1st command executed successfully (see below).

Example:
  
[root@python shell_scripting_class]# echo 123 & echo 456

[1] 3558
456
123
[1]+  Done           echo 123

As we can see here command "echo 123" was send in the background and proceed with the second command "echo 456". Also informed us once the second command is executed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; : Process the command sequentially , means one after another.

[root@python shell_scripting_class]# echo 123 ; echo 456
123
456
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&& : It execute the second command only if the first one was successful.

Example:

[root@python shell_scripting_class]# ls random_directory && echo 456

ls: cannot access 'random_directory': No such file or directory

As we can see , here first command "ls random_directory" was failed or returned non zero exit code , hence second command did not execute.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


|| : It execute the second command only if the first one was failed.

Example:

[root@python shell_scripting_class]# echo 123 || echo 456
123

As we can see first command "echo 123" was successful or returned exit code 0 , so second command did not execute.
