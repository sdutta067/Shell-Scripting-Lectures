Hello,



Could you please describe me little bit more about "shift" command.



As in the given function, I am not able to understand the concept of shift here.

++++++++++++++

log () {

        local VERBOSE="${1}"

        shift

        local MESSAGE="${@}"

        if [[ "${VERBOSE}" = "true" ]]

        then

                echo "${MESSAGE}"

        fi

}

VERBOSITY='true'

log 'true' 'Hello !'

log "${VERBOSITY}" 'This is Fun !!'

++++++++++++++

The shift command removes some number of arguments from the beginning of the arguments list.  The default number of arguments to remove is 1, so in the script above the shift command with no arguments will remove just the first argument.  After the first argument is removed, what used to be the second argument becomes the new first argument, the third argument becomes the second, etc.

For example, a later project has you provide a script with a user name and then a comment for the user, like the user's name.  That means you might call the script with:

./add-new-local-user john John Smith

The first argument, "john", would be the username.  After processing it, you could use shift to drop it from the argument list to change the argument list to just "John Smith".  Then you can use the full argument array ($@) to set the comment.  This would be more reliable than just using the second and third arguments because the shift lets you handle an uncertain number of remaining arguments (like if the arguments include their middle name along with first and last).
